🕵️ TraceHunter CLI

TraceHunter CLI — Extract. Analyze. Track digital traces from text files.

TraceHunter is a Python-based command line tool that scans text files and extracts useful digital information such as emails, phone numbers, URLs, and IP addresses using Regular Expressions.

This project was built as a hands-on learning project while practicing Python concepts like:

- File Handling
- Regular Expressions (Regex)
- Sets & Dictionaries
- Functions & Modular Programming
- JSON Export
- CLI Menu Design
